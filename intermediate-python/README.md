# Intermediate Python

Learning Python is crucial for any aspiring data science practitioner. Learn to visualize real data with Matplotlib’s functions and get acquainted with data structures such as the dictionary and pandas DataFrame. This four-hour intermediate course will help you to build on your existing Python skills and explore new Python applications and functions that expand your repertoire and help you work more efficiently.

You'll discover how dictionaries offer an alternative to Python lists, and why the pandas dataframe is the most popular way of working with tabular data. In the second chapter of this course, you’ll find out how you can create and manipulate datasets, and how to access them using these structures. Hands-on practice throughout the course will build your confidence in each area.

As you progress, you’ll look at logic, control flow, filtering and loops. These functions work to control decision-making in Python programs and help you to perform more operations with your data, including repeated statements. You’ll finish the course by applying all of your new skills by using hacker statistics to calculate your chances of winning a bet.

Once you’ve completed all of the chapters, you’ll be ready to apply your new skills in your job, new career, or personal project, and be prepared to move onto more advanced Python learning.

# Matplotlib

There are many visualization packages in python, but the mother of them all, is matplotlib. You will need its subpackage pyplot. By convention, this subpackage is imported as plt, like this. For our first example, let's try to gain some insights in the evolution of the world population. I have a list with years here, year, and a list with corresponding populations, expressed in billions, pop. In the year 1970, for example, 3.7 billion people lived on planet Earth. To plot this data as a line chart, we call plt-dot-plot and use our two lists as arguments. The first argument corresponds to the horizontal axis, and the second one to the vertical axis. You might think that a plot will pop up right now, but Python's pretty lazy. It will wait for the show function to actually display the plot. This is because you might want to add some extra ingredients to your plot before actually displaying it, such as titles and label customizations. I'll talk about that some more later on. Just remember this: the plot function tells Python what to plot and how to plot it. show actually displays the plot.

When we look at our plot, we see that the years are indeed shown on the horizontal axis, and the populations on the vertical axis.

There are four data points, and Python draws a line between them. In 1950, the world population was around 2 point 5 billion. In 2010, it was around 7 billion. So the world population has almost tripled in sixty years. What if the population keeps on growing like that? Will the world become over populated? You'll find out in the exercises.
